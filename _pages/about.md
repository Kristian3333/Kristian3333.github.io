Hello! I'm Kristian, a philosopher of science working on explanation, causation, and explainable AI.

Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Ghent University, looking into how explanations work in Explainable AI. Previously, I spent a year at the ISIS institute in the Faculty of Science at Radboud University, engaging in interdisciplinary research that spanned philosophy, physics, and computer science, looking at the topic of scientific understanding through and by AI.  My PhD focused on explanation in the engineering sciences, consisting of a blend of causal modelling, safety science, and the study of explanatory mechanisms in failure analysis. 

My academic interests lie at the nexus of Causal Explanation, Explainable AI, Deep Learning, and the Philosophy of Science in Practice.
When not immersed in research, I indulge in coffee research and consumption, programming, playing the piano, exploring blockchain technology applications, hitting the gym, and playing chess.
